Abstract:-
In recent years fraudulent transactions have become a major concern for the finance industry due to the amount lost every year. Manually analyzing the transactions and finding out the fraud transactions is a tedious task. Hence machine learnings algorithms can learn the patterns from the data and detect fraudulent transactions. But the significant challenge here is imbalanced data where non-fraudulent transactions are very dominant in the dataset. To overcome this problem, we will be using oversampling and under-sampling techniques. To detect the fraudulent transaction in the dataset we will be using ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest with sampling techniques
